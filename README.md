# Minor-Project

Project title: Finding the liklihood of a disease based on a patient's data using data mining.

Description:-

Our project aims to provide the liklihood of a disease that might be contracted by a person after analysing his or her medical data. It is to be noted that the functioning of our project seems to perform a predictive analysis. But in fact, our project just provides a vague estimation that a given person is very likely to suffer from a certain disease, let's say diarrhoea, instead of diseases like malaria.

For providing such functionality to our project, we are using Apriori algorithm.

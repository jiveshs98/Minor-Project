cab survey includes:   more than 2 lakh rows, 54 columns, 9 files for each state.

heart includes: 1 lakh rows, 8 columns, 1 file, 1 disease


If we use cab-survey:-

  Pros
  a) It will provide us with a wide variety of attributes and diseases.
  b) The criticality of data cleaning as well as preprocessing will increase.
  c) The weightage of the data science aspect will definitely increase.
  d) Greater scope of expandibility and usability.

  Cons (edited)
  a) It will take more time as compared to heart.
  b) More efforts and well structured and rigorous planning would be required.
  c) The process is likely to become complicated.
  d) Too much unwanted data to analyse.



If we use heart:-

  Pros
  a) It will take less time.
  b) Not much data science will be used.
  c) The process is more clear while planning the project.
  d) Relevant data present

  Cons
  a) Limited scope of the project.
  b) Only the likelihood of heart diseases will be calculated.
  c) Since only one disease would be the basis, the design as well as the working of our project(Specially the Gui ) would become Simpler
      yield lower functionality.

  d) So we will have to work harder on our presentation skills and frontend to make this project look state-of-the-art.

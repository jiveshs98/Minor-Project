To supplement the information provided by Annual Health Survey (AHS),a biomarker component has been introduced in AHS to collect data on nutritional status, life style diseases like diabetes & hypertension and anemia in Empowered Action Group (EAG) States & Assam. This component, namely Clinical, Anthropometric and Bio-chemical (CAB) survey, is conducted on a sub-sample of AHS in all EAG States namely Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand & Uttar Pradesh and Assam.

There are total of 1.89million observations and 53 variables in this dataset.
